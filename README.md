# PMGSY-EDA
PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL PROGRESS OF PRADHAN MANTRI GRAM SARAK YOJANA DATASET, EDA AND DATA VISUALIZATION AND DATA INSIGHTS

Introduction

In this data, we examine the impact and process of building roads and bridges under several government schemes. These projects facilitate an easy transportation system across different states and districts of India, contributing to regional development and connectivity.
The data consists of columns such as "Number of road work sanctioned," "Number of bridges balanced," "Length of road work completed in km," etc., along with their corresponding financial expenditures. Building infrastructure is essential for promoting regional integration, increasing accessibility, and boosting economic growth, especially in rural areas. Road and bridge connectivity between states and districts in India has been greatly improved by programs like the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). With a focus on road and bridge projects approved under different PMGSY stages (PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, and PMGSY-III) as well as other schemes like JANMAN and RCPLWEA, this report analyzes the status of such infrastructure projects.
Additionally, this data-driven analysis reveals significant patterns like: Which districts and states have taken the lead in authorizing and finishing infrastructure projects? How do project completion rates and regional development relate to investments in roads and bridges? Where are there large backlogs and what could be creating delays in particular places?
To guarantee that infrastructure goals are effectively accomplished, the report aims to identify important obstacles and areas that require more attention in addition to giving a broad overview of project progress. Policymakers, governmental organizations, and other stakeholders can use the analysis's insights to make well-informed decisions that will maximize resource allocation, cut down on project delays, and enhance the efficacy of upcoming infrastructure initiatives.

Objectives

o
To identify the states and districts that have sanctioned and completed the most road and bridge projects.
o
To assess the completion rates of sanctioned projects in different regions.
o
To analyze the financial expenditures associated with the sanctioned and completed works.
o
To examine the correlation between road and bridge project approvals and their completion rates.
o
To identify inefficiencies, delays, or bottlenecks in project execution and funding.

Data Cleaning
In this study, the data was already provided in a clean, structured, and consistent format. As a result, no additional data cleaning procedures, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, or correcting inconsistencies, were necessary. All variables and data points were in a usable state, allowing us to proceed directly to the analysis phase without any modifications.

Learnings

Positive Learnings:

•
High Completion Rates: States like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar have shown that road projects can be efficiently completed, especially when expenditures align well with sanctioned works.
•
Strong Correlation in Project Execution: Many states demonstrated a strong positive correlation between sanctioned projects and completed works, showcasing effective management.
•
Successful Fund Utilization: States like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar used their allocated resources effectively, completing more projects with less expenditure.
Negative Learnings:
•
Regional Disparities: Certain states like Nagaland, Mizoram, and Puducherry had far fewer sanctioned projects, reflecting uneven infrastructure development focus.
•
Inefficiencies in Fund Allocation: In states like Gujarat and Haryana, high expenditures were not matched by a proportionate number of completed projects, indicating potential delays or inefficiencies.
•
Backlogs and Delays: States such as Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced significant delays in project completion, with a large number of pending works.

Conclusion:

The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has been instrumental in improving rural road connectivity, boosting infrastructure, and fostering economic growth across various states. States like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bihar have efficiently utilized resources, resulting in high completion rates of road and bridge projects. However, the project also highlighted challenges such as regional disparities in project sanctioning and completion, under-utilization of funds in some areas, and inefficiencies in financial management. Addressing these issues will help ensure more equitable and efficient infrastructure development across the country.
In conducting this project, we extensively used Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and Matplotlib for visualizing key patterns and trends. These tools enabled us to draw meaningful insights from the data and make informed observations about the progress of the PMGSY. Through this process, we learned a great deal about data analysis, visualization techniques, and the interpretation of infrastructure-related data, all of which were critical to achieving the project’s objectives.
